	<h1> JAPAN </h1>
	<div align= "justify">
	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity as of 2019. As of 2019, Japan's labor force consisted of 67 million workers. 
		Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.4 percent. Around 16 percent of the population were below the poverty line in 2017. 
		Japan today has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP of any developed nation, with national debt at 236% relative to GDP as of 2017.
		Japan's exports amounted to 18.5% of GDP in 2018. As of 2019, Japan's main export markets were the United States (19.8 percent) and China (19.1 percent). 
		Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts. Japan's main import markets as of 2019 were China (23.5 percent), the United States (11 percent), and Australia (6.3 percent). 
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, food stuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.
		Japan ranks 29th of 190 countries in the 2019 ease of doing business index. 
		The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment. 
		Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world as of 2018. 
		Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015–2016.

	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contemporary Japanese society is decidedly urban. Not only do the vast majority of Japanese live in urban settings, but urban culture is transmitted throughout the country by a mass media largely concentrated in Tokyo. 
		Young urban Japanese in particular have become known for their conspicuous consumption and their penchant for trends and fads that quickly go in and out of fashion.
