	Herbert V. Melendez Jr. and Jeanett B. Melendez.<sup>3</sup> I have an older sister named Stephanie Herjay B. Melendez.<sup>4</sup> 
	My sister is my first best friend.<sup>5</sup> She always cares for me whenever our parents is not at home.<sup>6</sup> 
	When we were a child, both love to play, dance and swim.<sup>7</sup> She is also the one who defends me when someone on our school bullied me.<sup>8</sup>
	Up until now I can count here on anything.<sup>9</sup> She's the one who always gives me the best advices.<sup>10</sup>
	I thank God because he gave me the loving and caring sister ever.<sup>11</sup></blockquote>

	I decided to ask my parents where they got my name and then they told me that my names have meanings.<sup>13</sup> My name 'Sherrill'
	means beautiful meadow and 'Hannah' in Hebrew means "God's blessing".<sup>14</sup> After I knew the meanings of my names, I thank my parents because 
	they gave me the best names with wonderful meanings.<sup>15</sup>

	On my grade-school days, I studied at Santa Isabel College - Manila.<sup>20</sup> In my six years of stay at this school, 
	I have learned so many things that I will forever treasure.<sup>21</sup></p></blockquote>

	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adamson University has a special place in my heart.<sup>8</sup> I've stayed there for about six years, from Junior High School to Senior High School.<sup>9</sup>
	This school opened a lot of opportunities that came in to my life.<sup>10</sup> There are countless happy memories that happened in my previous school but the one that I will never forget
	is when my teacher forced me to join the Miss Teen Adamson 2015.<sup>11</sup> It was definitely my first time to join a pageant but I managed to pass the eliminations round and made it to
	top 6 out of 40 girls who also joined the pageant.<sup>12</sup>

	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I didn't got the crown, it is still the most unforgettable thing that happened to me because this pageant helped me to boost my confidence.<sup>13</sup>
	After that pageant, I also joined the Miss Adamson Earth Saver where I got the crown and Miss Intramurals where I placed as 2nd runner up.<sup>14</sup> Joining pageants 
	are fun for me because aside from gaining my confidence, I meet new friends, I learned how to act like a true beauty queen and it made me realize that I am capable of
	joining pageants.<sup>15</sup>

	I grow up.<sup>18</sup> I was one of the top students in our class.<sup>19</sup> I really love and enjoy our subjects and it made me become more inspired to be a newscaster someday.<sup>20</sup><br>

	on what job I might end up if I did not became a reporter.<sup>2</sup> So I decided to take up my second choice which is the BS Computer Science.<sup>3</sup>
	I was highly influenced by my sister since she finished the course BS Computer Science way back in 2018 in the same school as mine now which is the University of the East - Manila.<sup>4</sup>

	It was very sad because suddenly our class have stopped and lockdowns were implemented around our country.<sup>11</sup> Out of boredom I decided 
	to upload a video where I cooked one of my favorite dish which is the Creamy Beef with Mushroom.<sup>12</sup> It was only for fun and I don't have any expectations
	that it will become viral.<sup>13</sup> I was so shocked that when after I uploaded the video, I looked at the views it goes high every hour and in 
	less than a day, I gained 800k views on Tiktok.<sup>14</sup> Now, it has 1.4 million views on Tiktok.<sup>15</sup> After that video, I decided to upload more of my recipes
	since a lot of people are giving comments on my videos saying that I should share more of my recipes.<sup>16</sup> Tiktok opened a lot of opportunities for me that I can never ever imagine that will happen to my life.<sup>17</sup> 
	There are brands reaching out to me for them to be featured on my videos.<sup>18</sup></p>

	I was so kilig because I am a huge fan of Shopee and I love to buy different things from Shopee.<sup>20</sup> Through these, I could save enough money for my future and somehow help my parents in our bills.<sup>21</sup> 
	Until now, I still can't believe that it happened to my life and I thank God everyday because out of all the sad things that this pandemic had brought into my life, he still gave me more than what I need.<sup>22</sup></p>
