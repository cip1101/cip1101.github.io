	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raya and the 
	Last Dragon is an American animated film produced at Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed 
	by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It was released on March 5, 2021 and is the 59th animated 
	feature in the Disney Animated Canon. The film follows Raya, a warrior princess who must find the 
	fabled last dragon in order to save her divided home world from a ravenous plague. Throughout her 
	journey, Raya traverses the various kingdoms of Kumandra, with an eccentric band of misfits by her 
	side. All the while, they must evade the clutches of Raya’s longtime nemesis, Namaari. The setting 
	of Raya and the Last Dragon takes inspiration from Southeast Asian cultures and regions. The 
	titular dragon, Sisu, is modeled after the Nāga, a serpentine race found in Hinduism, Buddhism and 
	Jainism. To respectfully pay tribute to the region, the studio established a Southeast Asia Story 
	Trust—a coalition of specialists of various fields, including visual anthropology, linguistics, 
	botany, choreography, architecture, martial artists. </blockquote></p>
