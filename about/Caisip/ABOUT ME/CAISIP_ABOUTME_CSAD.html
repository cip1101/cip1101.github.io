	<sup>1</sup> My teenage years have been the best days of my life.
	<sup>2</sup> It was true that time and tide waits for no one.
	<sup>3</sup> It's really funny how time changes so fast.
	<sup>4</sup> This was the years when I am slowly having the responsibility in everything that I do.
	<sup>5</sup> This was the year when I need to remind myself that I should study for my future and I must be mindful of the things that I do.
	<sup>6</sup> I felt like I am living into the world where I can do everything, it was actually a clueless world.
	<sup>7</sup> But honestly, it was worst than I expected but I learned a lot of things.
	<sup>8</sup> I learned the value of my religion because I studied in a catholic school in Quezon City and I learned the value of frienship.
	<sup>9</sup> I've met A LOT of friends who also helped me in shaping my life into who I am today.
	<sup>10</sup> It was actually the bestest blessings that I have received from God.
	<sup>11</sup> The people that I've met this year was golden.
	<sup>12</sup> Well, of course I experienced a lot of difficulties and challenges when it comes to friends, but I've kept the genuine ones.
	<sup>13</sup> I actually cannot fully describe how grateful I am to have a these kinds of people around me including my family.
	<sup>14</sup> I also got a good grades because I really value the hardwork of my parents.
	<sup>15</sup> I also want to be passionate in everything that I do because I always think about making my parents proud.
	<sup>16</sup> I am happy that I also had a change to get along with my friends by going to a mall and hanging out with them.
	<sup>17</sup> On the other hand, I also experienced the most difficult and complicated parts in person's life.
	<sup>18</sup> My decisions as teenager makes a direct and influential impacts to my future, particularly towards their future college, job, and level of success. 
	<sup>19</sup> As if having to plan for my future is not scary enough, I am now old enough to uphold my own responsibilities and decisions.
	<sup>20</sup> I always keep in mind that change is normal and I should always think of the brighter side of life to always keep me going in all the things that I will be doing.

	<blockquote> <p> 
	<sup>1</sup> College life, well what can I really say.
	<sup>2</sup> College life exposes us to new experiences and things that we were not familiar with earlier. 
	<sup>3</sup> I am a second year college student at the University of the East-Manila.
	<sup>4</sup> I remember the first days when I took the entrance examination and got the result of the test afterwards.
	<sup>5</sup> It was actually surreal.
	<sup>6</sup> That was also the time when I realize that I am going to college. 
	<sup>7</sup> It is true that time flies really fast. 
	<sup>8</sup> I am actually scpeechless that I am in college right now and taking the path that I have decided.
	<sup>9</sup> Sometimes, I overthink about the decision of the program the I took.
	<sup>10</sup> I sometimes question myself a lot of times but you know, there's no room for false hopes.
	<sup>11</sup> I need to think about my future because my really goal is to make my parent's proud and spoil them with all the things that they want.
	<sup>12</sup> College has been tough especially when you met a lot of people from different schools but luckily, I made friends.
	<sup>13</sup> I cannot actually imagine life without my college friends.
	<sup>14</sup> They helped me through my ups and downs, especially to the days when I just want to give up.
	<sup>15</sup> Many hardships and difficulties has been made that crushed my heart so many times, but I should ALWAYS think the brighter side of life.
	<sup>16</sup> I am a second year college student and yet I experience those kinds of things.
	<sup>17</sup> The whole view of the world has been tough unlike those days when life was just a simple yes and no.
	<sup>18</sup> I kept telling to myself the purpose why am I doing this for me to work hard and not give up.
	<sup>19</sup> At the end of the day, I need to be passionate in everything that I do and be independent as a woman.
	<sup>20</sup> Now that I am closer to reality, I wish my decisions were aligned to the things that I really want in the future.
