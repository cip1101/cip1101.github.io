		Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields. 
		Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of the population lives in the capital, 
		Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal power and is home to the National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland’s Viking history. 
		Glacier ice and cooled lava each cover approximately one-tenth of the country’s total area. The glaciers are a reminder of Iceland’s 
		proximity to the Arctic Circle, which nearly touches its northernmost peninsula. The area covered by Vatnajökull (Vatna Glacier), 
		the country’s largest, is equal to the combined total area covered by all the glaciers on the continent of Europe. The volcanoes, 
		reaching deep into the unstable interior of the Earth, are explained by the fact that Iceland is located on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 
		It is estimated that since the year 1500 about one-third of the Earth’s total lava flow has poured out of the volcanoes of Iceland.
		Much of Iceland is underlain by basalt, a dark rock of igneous origin. The oldest rocks were formed about 16 million years ago. 
		The landscape in basaltic areas is one of plateau and fjord, characterized by successive layers of lava visible one above the other 
		on the valley sides. The basalt sheets tend to tilt somewhat toward the centre of the country. Iceland’s U-shaped valleys are 
		largely the result of glacial erosion.
