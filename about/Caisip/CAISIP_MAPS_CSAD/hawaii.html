		Hawaii is a U.S. state located in the Pacific Ocean approximately 2,000 mi from the U.S. mainland. It is the only state 
		outside North America, the only island state, and the only state in the tropics. Hawaii is also one of a few U.S. states 
		to have once been an independent nation. The gorgeous scenery, aloha spirit, stunning beaches, and exciting activities are 
		just a few of the reasons Hawaii is continually rated as a top vacation destination. Plus, it's also the perfect place to relax, 
		unwind and disconnect from your daily routine. Hawaii is a beautiful tropical vacation hot spot unlike any other in the world. 
		From its beautiful white sandy beaches and its majestic mountains and steep valleys to its city life, there really is something 
		for everyone to enjoy! Hawaii is the most diverse state and is a melting pot of all cultures. You will find influences from, 
		of course, Hawaiian culture, as well as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Portuguese, Samoan, Tahitian, Tongan, Micronesian, 
		and Spanishâ€”and the list goes on. The Hawaiian culture is very much alive, and it shows and shines through its people! 
		From its city and beach names (which are almost all still in the Hawaiian language) to hula demonstrations at luaus to 
		people speaking Hawaiian at the grocery store, the islands thrive on Hawaiian culture and its survival.
