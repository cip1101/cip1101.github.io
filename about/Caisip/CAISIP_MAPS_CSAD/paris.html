		Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. 
		Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the 
		Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer 
		boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. explore Paris by visiting the famous Eiffel Tower where you 
		can enjoy the views of the metropolis. Secure a direct access, so you won’t have to queue at the entrance. You can 
		combine your Eiffel tour with an hour-long ride on the Seine with wonderful views and with a visit to the Louvre Museum. 
		The world’s largest museum exhibits more than 35,000 items, which you can wonder at all day long with a ticket that will 
		enable you to jump the queue. If you’re interested to find out more about the museum, you can join a tour in the company 
		of an experienced guide. You can see whole Paris from the roof terrace of the Montparnasse Tower. Let yourself be charmed 
		by Paris’ surroundings. Head to the village of Giverny where the painter Claude Monet lived until his death. 
		Visit his house and gardens, full of beautiful plants that served as his inspiration. 
		Enjoy a walk down the cobbled streets of the village. Your trip will only be nothing less than perfect if you take your time 
		and travel by train.
