		New York City comprises 5 boroughs sitting where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean. At its core is Manhattan, 
		a densely populated borough that’s among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers. Its iconic sites 
		include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and sprawling Central Park. Broadway theater is staged in neon-lit 
		Times Square. New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and, 
		in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more images to 
		the collective consciousness of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue 
		is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian 
		lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, 
		African American aspirations, and slums.Its symbol is the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the arena in which 
		Emma Lazarus’s “tempest-tost” people of every nation are transformed into Americans—and if they remain in the city, they become 
		New Yorkers.
