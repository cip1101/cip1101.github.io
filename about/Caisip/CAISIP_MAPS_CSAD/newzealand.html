		New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island and 
		the South Island —and more than 700 smaller islands, covering a total area of 268,021 square kilometres. New Zealand is one 
		of the most sought-after destinations in the world. With its snow-capped mountains, ancient glaciers, rolling hills, and copious 
		amounts of wine, it’s a destination unlike all others. Tucked away in the corner of the world, it’s a country that requires some 
		planning to visit. Flights here aren’t cheap, after all. Round-trip flights from the US are almost always over $1,000 USD and the 
		journey takes upwards of 23 hours. And even when you arrive, the country itself is far from being budget-friendly. Yet even with 
		that in mind, it’s a destination I never get tired of visiting. New Zealand is worth every penny if you ask me. While it has seen 
		a boom in tourism in recent years, New Zealand is still the beautiful and unspoiled country I first visited many years ago. 
		Christchurch has recovered from its earthquakes and now a hip place to be; Wanaka is still offers incredible hiking; 
		the glaciers were just as mind-blowing as ever; the forests still home to wonderful walks; and Kiwis just as fun and friendly as 
		ever. In short, if New Zealand isn’t on your travel list it should be.
