		Japan is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, 
		and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Complexity and contrast are 
		the keynotes of life in Japan—a country possessing an intricate and ancient cultural tradition yet one that, since 1950, has emerged 
		as one of the world’s most economically and technologically advanced societies. Heavy emphasis is placed on education, and Japan is 
		one of the world’s most literate countries. Tension between old and new is apparent in all phases of Japanese life. 
		A characteristic sensitivity to natural beauty and a concern with form and balance are evident in such cities as Kyōto and Nara, 
		as well as in Japan’s ubiquitous gardens. Even in the countryside, however, the impact of rapid Westernization is evident in many 
		aspects of Japanese life. The agricultural regions are characterized by low population densities and well-ordered rice fields and 
		fruit orchards, whereas the industrial and urbanized belt along the Pacific coast of Honshu is noted for its highly concentrated 
		population, heavy industrialization, and environmental pollution.
