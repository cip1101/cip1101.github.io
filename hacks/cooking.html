						<h1>Cooking</span></h1>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">At its most basic, cooking means applying heat to food. 
						Whether the food is baked, fried, sautéed, boiled, or grilled, it's all cooking. 
						Evidence suggests our ancestors began cooking over an open fire over 2 million years ago. 
						People still cook some foods over an open flame, in addition to using tools like microwaves, toasters, and stovetops.
						In scientific terms, cooking is transferring energy from a heat source to the food.
						It is as much about the ways ​heat changes the food as it is about the heat itself. 
						That's because heating food does more than just make it hotter.

						<h1>1. Get More Acquainted with Rice</span></h1>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rice is the main dish in any Filipino meal, and is deeply imbedded in the Pinoy food culture. 
						It is not surprising since the country has wide hectares of land dedicated for rice farming. Rice is a perfect filler for the masses in the nation as well, especially those who cannot afford pricier meal options.
						That’s why you must know rice on a whole new level to make it more special!
						You can choose its traditional cooking process using a pot or a rice cooker.
						But you can also boost a simple rice by transforming it into a different dish.</p>

						<h1>2. Know More about Spices too</span></h1>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ferdinand Magellan reached the area that is what now known as the Philippines because he’s seeking a good source of spices for Spain. 
						And we still enjoy those spices until today.
						We have onions, garlic, pepper corn, lemon grass and pandan among many other spices. 
						Yes, they do help you achieve ideal flavors when cooking. But there are a few tips you should remember about these spices to achieve best results.
						<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp First, prefer whole spices instead of buying grounded ones. 
						Fresh and whole spices gives better flavor to any dish. 
						If you wish, you can simply grind them right before use.
						Second, remember that there are different types for each spice, and they bring unique flavor to your food. 
						Garlic alone has at least three types in the country, and you’ve probably stumbled upon red, yellow and white onions too.</p>

						<h1>3. Use Seasonings or Condiments Properly</span></h1>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Talking about seasonings would make you think of salt, pepper, vinegar and soy sauce among others. 
						But you can’t simply add them into your dish. 
						Always be careful to avoid getting unpleasant results.
						Put them little by little while tasting the food along. 
						This will help you get the best flavor from them.
						<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Do not become too dependent on salt for fixing undesirable taste in the food you’re cooking. 
						This is, in fact, one of the most important Pinoy cooking tips and hacks that many Filipino miss. 
						For example, you’ve mixed in too much vinegar or lemon juice into the pot. 
						Instead of pinching some salt, consider adding a very small amount of baking soda to neutralize the taste.</p>

						<h1>4. Slow Cooking is a Virtue</span></h1>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slow cooking is one of the best techniques which brings out a lot of flavor from different dishes.
						Say, you’re cooking beef caldereta. Cooking it slow for an extended period helps in making the meat become softer. 
						It helps the flavors completely blend together too.
						You may even resort to using different cooking techniques for a single dish. 
						For example, it is suggested to sear the meat before using it in adobo, afritada, caldereta or some other recipe.  
						This is to help in making the meat more flavorful, and make it appear more appealing because of its brownish color.</p>

						<h1>5. Know Many Other Dishes All Over the Country</span></h1>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp you must seek to explore other dishes that other regions in the Philippines offer. 
						Remember that each regions has its own culture, so it’s not surprising to find unique dishes too.
						There are even seemingly similar food that have different properties. 
						<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For example, there is a variation of Adobo in Mindanao that is called “Humba”. 
						It is also pork meat recipe with vinegar and soy sauce, but it’s has more sauce than Adobo. 
						Some Humba variation also focuses on pork fats instead of its lean meat.
						Knowing these variations adds more dishes in your personal recipe book. 
						This translates to more food variations that you can prepare for your loved ones too.</p>

						<h1 style="text-align:center">Essential Kitchen Tools:</span></h1>
						<blockquote><p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">
						<b>1. NON-STICK FRYING PAN</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every household needs a non-stick pan for breakfast duty since eggs and pancakes are best made on a non-stick surface. 
						It’s also a super versatile pan that can be used for searing meats, sauteing vegetables, and making sauces. 
						Just be careful to use non-abrasive tools on the surface!
						<br><br>
						<b>2. SAUCEPAN</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A saucepan is perfect for when you need to cook something with liquids, such as boiling pasta and vegetables or simmering sauces and beans. 
						<br><br>
						<b>3. STOCK POT</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For bigger batches of soups, stews, and pasta, you’ll want to have a 12-quart stock pot around. Its base allows for even heating, so your soups cook evenly.
						<br><br>
						<b>4. SHEET PANS</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp These pans can get a lot of action, including roasting vegetables, baking meats, toasting nuts, and of course, baking cookies. 
						They also make for an easy clean-up with sheet pan dinners.
						<br><br>
						<b>5. GLASS BAKING DISH</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Glass baking dishes are perfect for baking things like casseroles and enchiladas in the oven. 
						Because it’s microwave-safe, an 8-inch size can fit into a microwave for the times you need to pre-cook vegetables for the quick Microwave & Saute Cooking Method or even to fully cook veggies when your oven and stove are all occupied.
						<br><br>
						<b>6. KNIVES</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you’re cooking, you’re going to be using a knife. 
						If you only have money and space for one knife, get a chef’s knife. 
						You will use this knife for 90% of your food prep, so buy a nice one and take care of it. 
						However, we highly recommend getting a serrated knife and a paring knife as well since they serve different purposes – serrated knives let you slice through tomatoes and bread with ease, and paring knives are great for smaller, more delicate jobs, when a big knife just doesn’t cut it.
						<br><br>
						<b>7. MEASURING SPOONS</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Even if you like to “eyeball” ingredients, it’s handy to have a set of measuring spoons around for the times you need precise measurements. 
						But also, they double as mini spoons for scooping spices and dried herbs!
						<br><br>
						<b>8. MEASURING CUPS</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Measuring cups are absolutely crucial If you’re a baker, but it’s also great for everyday cooking. 
						Some like to keep a 4-piece set for measuring dried ingredients and small amounts of liquid. 
						A 1-quart glass measuring cup makes measuring liquids a lot more convenient and efficient, and you can also make sauces and vinaigrettes right inside and then simply pour it into whatever you’re cooking up.
						<br><br>
						<b>9. WOODEN SPOONS</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wooden spoons are not abrasive on your cooking surfaces and they’ll last forever. 
						Just don’t put them in the dishwasher!
						<br><br>
						<b>10. FISH TURNER</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While this handy tool is advertised as a fish turner, it can be used for anything. 
						The wider base of this tool makes it easy to flip burgers, fish, over-easy eggs, and even pancakes. 
						The thin, beveled edge makes it easy to slide beneath the foods you are flipping, and the slots allow any grease to drain.
						<br><br>
						<b>11. PEELER</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When you’re setting up your kitchen with the basics, you want to make sure you have a good, sharp peeler to remove the peels of vegetables, shave off cheese, or make veggie ribbons.
						<br><br>
						<b>12. WHISK</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While forks and chopsticks can be handy, a whisk is quicker and more efficient for emulsifying ingredients like vinegars and oils. 
						<br><br>
						<b>13. TONGS</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tongs are like your extended hands and are super useful in the kitchen! 
						Not only are they used to flip big pieces of food, but they also help move ingredients around in a frying pan or on a sheet pan without the risk of burns.
						<br><br>
						<b>14. CUTTING BOARD</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A good, grippy cutting board will protect your fingers during all your prep work.
						Plastic boards can be placed in the dishwasher for full disinfecting.
						<br><br>
						<b>15. COLANDER</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every kitchen needs a heavy-duty colander for draining out boiled pasta and vegetables. 
						It is also used for draining canned beans and freshly washed veggies.
						<br><br>
						<b>16. PREP BOWLS IN EVERY SIZE</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every kitchen needs a set of prep bowls to help you organize all your ingredients. 
						If you get collapsible prep bowls, you’ll save a lot of space and have the convenience of covers that can seal off ingredients that are not quite ready for cooking yet. 
						But glass prep bowls can also double as serving dishes!
						<br><br>
						<b>17. CAN OPENER</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A can opener is something you don’t want to forget! 
						Canned beans and vegetables make for quick-cooking and are great pantry staples, but a bunch of things also come in cans that require a can opener – coconut milk, curry paste, fruits, crushed tomatoes, etc.
						<br><br>
						<b>18. MICROPLANE ZESTER</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This may not seem like a very necessary tool to have in a basic kitchen, but it makes a huge difference when you’re looking to up the flavor in your meals. 
						A zester is used for zesting lemons and limes, and grating ginger and cheese.
						<br><br>
						<b>19. IMMERSION / STICK BLENDER</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forget the bulk of a blender! 
						You can now make pureed soups right in their pot, blend single-serving smoothies, and get extra creamy and smooth vinaigrettes / dressings.
						It’s so convenient, even its clean up is easy – simply pop off the blade for super quick cleaning.
						<br><br>
						<b>20. SALAD SPINNER</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A colander may be sufficient enough for drying lettuce, but a salad spinner is a whole lot more efficient. 
						Salad dressings have a difficult time adhering to lettuce that is still wet and people have a difficult time with soggy tacos and sandwiches. 
						A salad spinner is the answer to your problems because it will help you get rid of water in a matter of seconds and save on paper towels. 
						You can also use this tool to dry fresh herbs.
