						<h1>Baking</span></h1>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">Baking, process of cooking by dry heat, especially in some kind of oven. 
						It is probably the oldest cooking method. Bakery products, which include bread, rolls, cookies, pies, pastries, and muffins, are usually prepared from flour or meal derived from some form of grain. 
						Baking techniques improved with the development of an enclosed baking utensil and then of ovens, making possible thicker baked cakes or loaves.

						<h1 style="text-align:center"> Here are some basic baking tips for beginners which will surely help you guys- especially if you’re just beginning to try your hand out at baking: </span></h1>
						<blockquote><p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">
						<b>Stick to the Recipe</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first and foremost thing you should be remembering, besides the basic ingredients to your recipe, is to always and no matter what blindly following the given recipe. 
						If it asks you to preheat your oven to a 180 degree Celsius, do that! If it asks you to sift your flour, do that!
						Follow each step and in the respective order the recipe is asking you to. 
						Dessert recipes are actually simple to follow and they have been tried and tested before being posted, so trust that the order holds a lot of significance.
						Sticking to recipes is a favor you’ll be doing to your own self!
						There are so many common mistakes that we anyway end up committing.
						<br><br>
						<b>Set up ingredients before you start</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Having all the ingredients in front of you before you start whipping up your recipe is such a comfort! 
						Measure all ingredients properly by using the required instruments and have them laid down in front of you so you are not running berserk in the middle of your preparation.
						Most culinary chefs swear by this tip and it ensures that your baking is a smooth and relaxing process and you don’t end up sweating or stressing yourself out.
						<br><br>
						<b>Investing in the right equipment</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The right equipment will not only make your preparation 5x easier, but they also end up ensuring that you’re doing your recipe right. 
						Like, silicone spatulas have taken the baking world by a storm and evidently to another level. 
						Uniformly mixing your cake ingredients, ensuring that each drop of your batter has been transferred to the tin, to even cleaning out your final platter, silicone spatulas have become no less than a wish come true.
						<br><br>
						<b>Room temperature is important</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When a recipe asks you to use a certain room temperature ingredient, most common being butter, stick to it, so when you beat your butter and sugar, it results in a cake that is nice and fluffy.
						Different temperatures of many ingredients give a different type of consistency- most often the consistency that you never wanted and it might also result in unavoidable lumps which means that all your hard work goes down the drain.
						<br><br>
						<b>Invest in a measuring equipment</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There is a variety of measuring equipment in the market today! 
						From measuring cups to weighing scales, from metal measuring sets to plastic measuring sets, you can find anything as of today to make your preparation super easy. 
						Most recipes ask for measuring cups and it is best if you invest in a set- any that you feel comfortable with. 
						The sets include tablespoons, teaspoons, and so on. 
						They also help you in saving your time judiciously because you’re not figuring out what or how to measure your ingredients!
						<br><br>
						<b>Parchment paper</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you need to ensure to one hundred percent that your cake isn’t sticking to the bottom of the pan, parchment paper is the answer to all your prayers! Indeed, there are other methods like oiling or dusting with flour, but there is nothing like a good ol’ parchment paper that is allowing your cake to come out in the most beautiful way possible!
						<br><br>
						<b>Use an ice cream scooper for cookies</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When baking cookies, ensure that your cookie dough is firm and cold and use an ice cream scooper to put it onto the baking tray. 
						An ice cream scooper will ensure that most of your cookies are blossoming into one size only and will also save you from a lot of stress and dirty hands.
						<br><br>
						<b>Always sift dry ingredients</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dry ingredients like flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar, cocoa powder, and so on, should always be sifted. 
						Even if the recipes don’t ask for it.
						Sifting allows your ingredients to get lighter and it allows the involvement of air. 
						Sifted dry ingredients which become lighter than unsifted dry ingredients are easier to mix in the batter or in the dough.
						Not only this, sifting ensures that all of your individual dry ingredients come together to give a uniform mixture before you start with the batter or dough.
						<br><br>
						<b>Taking out sticky ingredients from measuring cups</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sticky ingredients like honey and peanut butter are present in a lot of baking recipes out there. But, measuring them is indeed a pain.
						In order to get them out completely and without hassle, preferably spray or oil your measuring cup before proceeding with measuring such ingredients and always use a silicone spatula to completely take out all the remnants in the cup.

						<h1 style="text-align:center">10 Baking Tools You Must Have As A Baker:</span></h1>
						<blockquote><p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">
						<b>1. Silicon Mat</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A silicon mat is made of a high-quality silicon and it is used for making cookies and macarons. 
						It helps them from not spreading and hold their texture. It is actually a better replacement of parchment paper as it is reusable. 
						Whether you are baking cookies or kneading dough, you can use silicone baking mats. To use it on a tray, just place the mat on a baking tray before putting your cookies, macarons etc. on it. 
						If you think that the dough may still stick to the mat, then spray the mat with a non-stick spray before placing.
						<br><br>
						<b>2. Bundt Pan</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you’re looking for a stunning, show-stopper dessert, you should definitely invest in a bundt pan. 
						Since the middle of bundt pans are hollow, most of the batter touches the sides of the pan and result in quite a crusty edge that not only tastes fantastic, but makes frosting / icing look so beautiful.
						<br><br>
						<b>3. Weighing scale</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I know most of us are very used to using cups and spoons for measurements, but metric is much more accurate if you’re a professional baker or are planning to start a bakery. 
						It’ll definitely help you to weigh your final product and price it accordingly
						<br><br>
						<b>4. Turntable</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It makes everything easier and better.
						Not to forget the time a baker can save decorating cakes, It'll give you more time to enjoy the shooting process and of course, eating the cake.
						<br><br>
						<b>5. Palette Knives</b>
						<br>Palette knives for cakes are an equivalent of pen for paper in the baking world. 
						Your work with palette knives get better with practice. 
						But if you’ve never used one before, it could take some time getting used to them. 
						But once you do, you’re gonna love your cakes!
						<br><br>
						<b>6. Cast Iron Skillets</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every baker and cook knows that they gotta keep at least one cast iron skillet in their kitchen staples. 
						But if you’re just starting out, then you definitely need to start out with a good quality cast iron skillet. 
						The purpose of a cast iron skillet ranges from baking to even daily cooking, it’s basically very versatile.
						<br><br>
						<b>7. Blow Torch</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is not much of an essential baking tool but bakers still love using it so much for torching their meringues and marshmallows.
						<br><br>
						<b>8. Springform pan</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A springform pan is a such an important baking tool if you like making cheesecakes, mousse cakes and frozen cakes.
						It has a lock and a removable base, which leads to a beautiful cake with smooth edges.
						<br><br>
						<b>9. Frosting tools</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once you run them on a frosted cake, you get a really nice, clean and professional look. 
						These are particularly great for people who are just starting out with frosting cakes but get intimidated by different piping techniques and styles.
						<br><br>
						<b>10. Bench scrapers</b>
						<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bakers use the bench scraper when their working with yeasted doughs, these are very helpful when you’re shaping a dough as well as for cleaning your work surfaces as this will easily help you scrape off any excess dough off your counters!
